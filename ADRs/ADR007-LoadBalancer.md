## Title
Load Balancer Implementation for Managing High Volume Traffic

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
The Road Warrior will experiencing high volumes of traffic. Load balancing is required to distribute traffic evenly and ensure high availability. 

## Decision Drivers
- Scalability: Cosmos DB provides horizontal scaling and automatic partitioning, allowing us to handle high volumes of data and traffic as our system grows. 
- Global distribution: Cosmos DB offers multi-region replication, ensuring low latency access to data from different geographical locations. This is beneficial for our users who may be traveling internationally. 
- Flexible data model: Cosmos DB supports various data models, such as key-value, document, graph, and column-family. We can choose the most suitable model to represent our travel details, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. 
- SLA and high availability: Cosmos DB guarantees high availability and provides Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) for uptime, ensuring our system is reliable for our users. 
- Integration with Azure services: Cosmos DB seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure API Management, allowing us to build a comprehensive travel management system.

## Decision
Implement Load Balancer to manage the high volume of traffic. 

## Consequences
- Scalability: Load Balancer implementation allows for horizontal scaling, enabling the system to handle increasing traffic loads. 
- High Availability: Load Balancer ensures that traffic is distributed evenly across multiple instances, reducing the risk of single points of failure. 
- Performance Optimization: The Load Balancer intelligently routes traffic to the most available and responsive instances, optimizing overall system performance. 
- Traffic Management: Load Balancer offers various load balancing algorithms to distribute traffic, such as round-robin, least connections, and session-based, allowing for efficient utilization of resources. 
- Improved User Experience: Load Balancer implementation ensures uninterrupted service and improved response times, providing a better user experience. 
- Configuration Complexity: Setting up and configuring the Load Balancer may require additional effort and expertise. 
- Security Considerations: Proper security configurations need to be implemented to protect the Load Balancer and the instances behind it. 
- Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Monitoring and troubleshooting tools should be set up to identify and address any issues related to Load Balancer implementation.
