## Title
Implementing CDN for Road Warrior 

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
The application is expected to serve a large number of users across different geographical locations. To ensure optimal performance and reduce latency, it is proposed to implement a Content Delivery Network (CDN) .

## Decision Drivers
- Improved Performance
- Reduced Latency

## Decision
Approve. Implement a CDN to improve content delivery and enhance the performance. 

## Consequences
- Improved Performance: By implementing a CDN, the static assets of Road Warrior, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, are cached on distributed servers located closer to the users. This reduces the load on the backend systems and improves the performance of the application. 
- Reduced Latency: With a CDN, the content is delivered to users from a server that is geographically closer to them. This reduces the latency and improves the overall user experience. 
- Scalability: The CDN provides scalability by distributing the content across multiple servers. This ensures that the application can handle a large number of simultaneous requests from users without impacting performance. 
- Increased Availability: The CDN improves the availability of Road Warrior by providing redundancy and failover mechanisms. If one server goes down, the CDN can automatically route the requests to another available server, ensuring uninterrupted service. 
- Cost: Implementing a CDN may involve additional costs, such as subscription fees or usage-based charges. However, the improved performance and user experience may outweigh the cost implications. 
- Configuration and Maintenance: Setting up and configuring the CDN may require additional effort and expertise. Ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the CDN infrastructure will also be required to ensure optimal performance. 
- Cache Invalidation: The CDN caches static assets, which may lead to challenges in cache invalidation when updates are made to Road Warrior. Proper cache invalidation strategies need to be implemented to ensure users receive the latest content. 
Overall, implementing a CDN for Road Warrior offers significant benefits in terms of performance, latency reduction, scalability, and availability. The associated costs and effort for setup and maintenance need to be considered, and cache invalidation strategies should be implemented effectively.
