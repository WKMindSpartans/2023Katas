# Architectural Decision Record
## Date

## Title
Implementing CQRS in for Road Warrior Analytics 

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
The Road Warrior will implement the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architectural pattern to separate read and write operations

## Decision Drivers
- Scalability: By separating read and write operations, we can scale each side independently based on its specific requirements. This allows us to optimize our system's performance and handle high read or write loads more effectively. 
- Performance: CQRS allows us to optimize read operations by denormalizing data in read models, making queries faster and more efficient. We can design the read models specifically for different use cases, ensuring optimal data retrieval. 
- Modularity: CQRS promotes loose coupling and enables the evolution of the write and read components independently. 
- Flexibility: CQRS allows for different data models and storage mechanisms for reads and writes, enabling tailored optimizations.

## Decision
Approved

## Consequences
- Increased Complexity: CQRS introduces additional complexity compared to traditional monolithic architectures. We need to ensure proper documentation, training, and knowledge sharing to mitigate this challenge. 
- Tooling and Infrastructure: Implementing CQRS may require specific tooling and infrastructure to support event sourcing, event handling, and communication between read and write sides. We need to evaluate and select appropriate technologies and libraries. 
- Team Collaboration: CQRS may require a close collaboration between developers, domain experts, and stakeholders to ensure a clear understanding of the domain and its modeling.
