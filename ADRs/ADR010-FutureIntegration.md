## Title
Integration with Insurance Company for cancellation and other claims

## Status
Proposed 

## Context 
We anticipate the need to integrate Road Warior with an insurance company in the future to enable claims for cancellations. This integration will require communication between our app and the insurance company's systems to verify and process claims.

## Decision
We will design and implement an integration layer between our travel app and the insurance company's systems to facilitate claims for cancellations. 

##Justification: 
- Seamless user experience: Integrating with an insurance company will enhance the user experience by providing a streamlined process for submitting and processing claims directly within our app. 
- Reduced manual effort: By automating the claims process, we can minimize the need for manual intervention and reduce the time and effort required to process and verify claims. 
- Enhanced functionality: Integration with an insurance company will add value to our travel app by offering additional services and benefits to our users, such as cancellation protection and reimbursement for eligible cancellations. 
- Data synchronization: Integrating our app with the insurance company's systems will involve synchronizing relevant data, such as travel booking details, cancellation policies, and claim status updates. This will ensure accurate and up-to-date information is available to both parties 

##Alternatives
- Manual claims submission: Instead of integrating with an insurance company, we could rely on users manually submitting claims through the insurance company's website or app. However, this approach may introduce additional steps and inconvenience for our users. 

## Consequences
- Security and privacy: Integration with an insurance company will require sharing sensitive data between systems. We need to ensure proper security measures are in place to protect user information and comply with data privacy regulations. 
- Maintenance and support: Integrating with the insurance company's systems will introduce additional dependencies and potential maintenance requirements. We need to ensure the integration is well-documented, monitored, and supported to address any issues or changes that may arise. 
- Contractual agreements: Integration with an insurance company may involve entering into contractual agreements, such as service-level agreements (SLAs) and data-sharing agreements. We need to engage in legal and business discussions to establish the terms and conditions of the integration.
- User consent and transparency: Before integrating with an insurance company, we need to ensure that users are informed and provide their consent for sharing their data with the insurance company for claim processing purposes.
