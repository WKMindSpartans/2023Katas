## Title
Using BFF Gateway in the Road Warrior

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
We are developing Road Warrior hosted on Azure that requires data from multiple backend services such as flight booking, hotel booking, and car rental. To enhance the performance, security, and maintainability of the app, we are considering implementing a Backend for Frontend (BFF) Gateway.

## Decision Drivers
- Backend Service Aggregation: The BFF Gateway will aggregate data from multiple backend services, reducing the number of API calls made by the frontend. This will improve performance by minimizing network latency and reducing the overhead of multiple requests. 
- Data Transformation: The BFF Gateway will transform the data received from backend services into a format optimized for the frontend application. This will reduce the complexity and data processing required on the frontend side, enabling a better user experience. 
- Performance Optimization: By aggregating data and reducing API calls, the BFF Gateway will improve the overall performance and response time of Road Warrior. It will minimize the latency caused by multiple round trips to backend services, resulting in faster data retrieval and rendering on the frontend. 
- Security and Authorization: The BFF Gateway will handle authentication and authorization for the frontend application. It will ensure that only authorized requests are forwarded to the backend services, enhancing security measures and simplifying the authentication logic for individual services. 
- Versioning and Compatibility: The BFF Gateway will manage versioning and compatibility between the frontend and backend services. It will enable gradual updates and changes, shielding the frontend from potential breaking changes in backend services and ensuring smooth integration and compatibility. 
- Scalability and Maintenance: While introducing additional complexity, the BFF Gateway can be designed for scalability and ease of maintenance. By centralizing the integration logic and providing a unified interface for the frontend, it will simplify future updates and modifications to the backend services. 

## Decision
Approved. 
We will use a BFF Gateway in Road Warrior. 

## Consequences
- Increased Complexity: Implementing a BFF Gateway will introduce additional complexity to the architecture. It will require dedicated development and maintenance efforts to ensure the proper functioning of the gateway. 
- Single Point of Failure: The BFF Gateway can become a single point of failure if not designed and implemented carefully. Adequate measures should be taken to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. 
- Potential Performance Bottlenecks: If not properly optimized, the BFF Gateway can become a performance bottleneck, as it acts as a central hub for data aggregation and transformation. Careful design and optimization should be considered to mitigate this risk. 
- Increased Development Effort: Developing and maintaining a BFF Gateway will require additional development effort compared to a direct integration approach. This should be taken into account during resource planning and project management. 
- Improved Performance and User Experience: Despite the above consequences, the decision to use a BFF Gateway is expected to result in improved performance, reduced network latency, and enhanced user experience in Road Warrior.
