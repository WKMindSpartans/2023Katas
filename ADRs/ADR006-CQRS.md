## Title
Implementing CQRS in the Road Warrior

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
The Road Warrior will implement the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architectural pattern to separate read and write operations

## Decision Drivers
- Scalability: By separating read and write operations, we can scale each side independently based on its specific requirements. This allows us to optimize our system's performance and handle high read or write loads more effectively. 
- Performance: CQRS allows us to optimize read operations by denormalizing data in read models, making queries faster and more efficient. We can design the read models specifically for different use cases, ensuring optimal data retrieval. 
- Maintainability: With CQRS, we can clearly separate the logic and responsibilities of read and write operations. This separation simplifies maintenance and enhances code modularity, making it easier to understand, test, and modify each side independently. 
- Domain Complexity: If our application deals with complex domain models or multiple data sources, CQRS provides a clear and structured approach to handle the complexity. It allows us to model the domain more accurately and maintain a better separation of concerns. 
- Event Sourcing: Adopting CQRS opens the possibility of leveraging event sourcing, where we capture and store events representing changes to our write models. This provides a historical log of actions, enabling features like auditing, replaying events, and synchronization across distributed systems. 
- Future Extensibility: CQRS prepares our application for future extensibility. As our app evolves, we can introduce additional read or write models, or even introduce microservices for specific functionalities. CQRS provides a flexible foundation for such changes.

## Decision
Approved

## Consequences
- Increased Complexity: CQRS introduces additional complexity compared to traditional monolithic architectures. We need to ensure proper documentation, training, and knowledge sharing to mitigate this challenge. 
- Tooling and Infrastructure: Implementing CQRS may require specific tooling and infrastructure to support event sourcing, event handling, and communication between read and write sides. We need to evaluate and select appropriate technologies and libraries. 
- Team Collaboration: CQRS may require a close collaboration between developers, domain experts, and stakeholders to ensure a clear understanding of the domain and its modeling.
